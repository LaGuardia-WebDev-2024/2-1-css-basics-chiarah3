    <p>The <em>Red Panda</em> is awesome because...I mean, look at it. Red Panda's are adorable, and are accustomed to sleeping for long lengths during the day in trees. They're social with each other, and as you can see, very fluffy, and very red. They are very distant  relatives of the Panda bear, despite it's name, and share more genetic similarities with weasles, skunks, and (as one can probably tell from their appearence) racoons. Unfortunatley, Red Panda's are very endangered, due to habitation loss (deforestation) mixed in with poaching. Trust, I will fix this, give me a couple years.  <strong></strong></p>
